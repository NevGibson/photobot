Notes on our AIS receiver:

we have a Digital Yacht AISNET AIS Base Station Receiver part number ZDIGAISNET
http://www.digitalyachtamerica.com/index.php/en/products/ais-systems/ais-receivers/product/38-aisnet-internet-base-station

From the Digital Yacht site:

Network enabled AIS receiver for base station operation. Simple RJ45 network interface and USB too. Perfect for use with Marine Traffic or AIS Live‚Äù"
- what is AIS Live?
- can be used to send data to online AIS tracking services
- "Data that AISnet is collecting, can also be viewed locally on your PC using the free
  SmarterTrack Lite software. Plug the USB connector into your PC and AIS data will appear on your PC, 
  whilst also transmitting over the internet."

Drivers:

From digitial yacht:
"The drivers for the USB connection will work with the MAC. You can use NavLink and MacENC software too to view locally"
- navlink is DY's plotting software, looks like we can plug the AISNet right into it? it's $30.00

DY have tech support notes here:

see note: How to install the USB to NMEA Interface Mac OsX drivers 

On the DY utilities page there is a download for a 
Simple NMEA0183 Display program that allows you to display raw and formatted NMEA0183 data on your Windows PC, ideal for diagnostics

Found the Mac drivers here:
http://www.digitalyachtamerica.com/index.php/en/support/support-manuals/utilities

Figured out:
- the AISNet uses Digital Yacht's USB-to-NMEA0138 adapter, and the software
  reads the NMEA stream
- get that working on OSX first and examine the data
- ask DY about a linux USB to NMEA converter

1. 
I prefer to set up the wifi after copying the image file to the sd card - after this is done, I edit the 
etc/network/interfaces file to include:

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
    wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

iface default inet dhcp

and the etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf to include:

country=GB
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
  ssid="AT_HOME"
  psk="SUPERSECRET"
  }

2.
also the wget doesn't work with the current locator as indicated in instruction sheet 
(https://github/paddiohar/photobot/blob/master/photobot_install.py) - all you get is a bunch of html code
in the newly created photobot_install.py so I simply copied the contents of the photobot_install.py on the 
github page and pasted into a blank photobot_install.py using the nano editor
this new photobot_install.py seems to work fine.

3. 
while running photobot_install.py script - mostly straightforward until you set up USB drive and it asks for "Enter drive number:"
not clear what it's looking for - /dev/sda1 or UUID or PARTUUID
also - if this is a permanent device id, will this cause problems when we swap out usb hard-drives? (i.e., does this do something 
permanent to the fstab?)
i've read that a potential solution for automounting a USB storage is to add the line:
/dev/sda1      /mnt/data    ext3      defaults      0      0
to the fstab. The only problem is that the drive may not always be identified as /dev/sda1. I am okay with this because of the simplicity
of our system at this stage. If the system becomes more complicated we may wish to create scripted rules such as "mount manager" 
described in this website: http://solvedforhome.com/?p=2806&v=3e8d115eb4b3
At this point, if it ain't broke don't fix it. 

4. also running photobot installer - had a problem with the line "reload cron to test" and when i answered y - it came back with the
following error - "ERROR executing command: 'resart cron'
/bin/sh: 1: restart: not found. And camera doesn't start up on it's own after the full install.

5. not clear how to change photo sequence (i.e., frequency of capture for example).

1. 
I prefer to set up the wifi after copying the image file to the sd card - after this is done, I edit the 
etc/network/interfaces file to include:

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
    wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

iface default inet dhcp

and the etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf to include:

country=GB
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
  ssid="AT_HOME"
  psk="SUPERSECRET"
  }

2.
also the wget doesn't work with the current locator as indicated in instruction sheet 
(https://github/paddiohar/photobot/blob/master/photobot_install.py) - all you get is a bunch of html code
in the newly created photobot_install.py so I simply copied the contents of the photobot_install.py on the 
github page and pasted into a blank photobot_install.py using the nano editor
this new photobot_install.py seems to work fine.

3. 
while running photobot_install.py script - mostly straightforward until you set up USB drive and it asks for "Enter drive number:"
not clear what it's looking for - /dev/sda1 or UUID or PARTUUID
also - if this is a permanent device id, will this cause problems when we swap out usb hard-drives? (i.e., does this do something 
permanent to the fstab?)

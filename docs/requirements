TODO:
- choose the battery:
- get power cable connectors for camera power from quail

- power supply to go from 12V big battery:
  - to 12V to AIS
  - 9V to Camera (which we'll splice)
  - 5V to Pi
  - (5V to drive? probably not necessary


- Battery
- Solar charger for battery
- Power supply
- Relay switch for Pi to 9V line:
- call Quaile electronics for that

- make image of the drive


- write script for capturing data from Digital Yacht
  
  

Voltage:
- the UBEC DC-DC step down could give us 5V,  $10

- this one is meant to handle fluctuating input and send out to the PI
- AES I think we ought to be able to just hook up? check current limitiations
- that leaves camera for 9V, could use 

- question, could we run the camera off only 5V??

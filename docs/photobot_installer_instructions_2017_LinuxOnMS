Setting up the Raspberry Pi 3 for photo capture, using the photobot installer script
====================================================================================

Requirements:
-------------
This document details how to get the Pi 3 working for photo capture. In this doc,

You will need:
- A computer running OSX, Windows, or Linux (the host)
- A raspberry Pi 3
- An SD card and reader, we will load the SD card from the host and put it in the Pi
- An ethernet cable and connection for the Pi
- Internet connection for your host and Pi, we assume you have wireless.


We have only tested these instructions on OSX. They should work (almost) identically on Linux.
It's definitely possible on Windows but the commands and tools are likely different. 

In our instructions:
"on your host" means commands exected on your computer (OSX, or Linux)
"on the pi":  menas commands exectued on the Pi at a command line prompt that we get to via SSH 

Lines in this document starting with '$' are commands typed at a terminal,
either on the host or the Pi. You don't need to type the '$', that's your prompt.


Overview of Steps:
------------------
1) Setup up Raspberry Pi with Raspbian Jessie, with SSH access 
2) Download the photobot installer script on to the pi
3) Run the installer


1: Setup Raspberry Pi System (from the host)
--------------------------------------------
We're going to install the Pi's operating system on an SD card, tweak it a bit,
put it in the Pi, boot up, and SSH into the Pi.


Download Raspbian Jessie Lite
  - on your host computer, download raspbian-jessie-lite
  https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
  - the latest at time of writing is: January 2017
  - we are using Jessie Lite as we will not be plugging a keyboard and monitor into the Pi, 
    we're going to do everything over SSH


Burn image on the SD card:
  - put the SD card in your card reader and plug it into the USB port on your host
  - find out the disk number of SD card by opening a terminal and executing:
    $ fdisk -l
  - look for the entry that matches the size of your card (so we know it's not your host hard drive)
  - for this example, on our machine it was: /dev/sdc
  - unmount that disk: 
    $ umount /dev/sdc
  - copy or move the image you downloaded to the current directory, and execute
    the following to copy that image onto your sd card
    $ sudo dd bs=1m if=2017-01-11-raspbian-jessie-lite.img of=/dev/sdc
  - note that in the above command, you must replace the name of the image file with your image
    and /dev/rdisk2 with /dev/X where X is your disk name 
    

Alter the image to enable SSH
  - as of 2017, Raspbian now disables SSH by default for security so we need to alter the image
    or we won't be able to get into the Pi when we boot
  - after burning the image, the boot sector of our burned image should automount on the host from 
    the card reader, as "Boot"
  - we need to put an empty file called 'ssh' in to the boot directory
  - in a terminal on your host, cd into the boot directory and execute:
    $ sudo nano ssh
  - save using command ^O then exit ^X
  - check that it worked:
    $ ls 
    - you should see the file called 'ssh' in there

Load into Pi
  - unmount your SD reader, take out the SD card, put card into pi
  - plug Pi into your network with an ethernet cable as it doesn't have wireless enabled yet
  - boot the Pi
  - on your host, find ip address of the pi using a portscanning application 
    - on OSX we used the application "ipscan" (free download)
  - for MS Putty.exe works really well
  - once we have the IP, we can ssh in to the pi from the host using username 'pi', password 'raspberry'
    $ ssh pi@192.168.1.68  
  - you are now on the Pi and will see a security warning message to change your password
  - on the pi, execute:
    $ passwd
  - remember this password, it is what you will use from now on when you ssh or sftp into
    the pi as user "pi" and is the password the pi will need whenever you use the "sudo" command
    

Download the Installer
----------------------
  - ssh into the pi
  - execute:
    wget https://github.com/paddiohara/photobot/blob/master/photobot_installer.py  
  - you should now see the python script "photbot_installer.py"


Run the Installer
-----------------
- you can now run the installer as root with the command:
  $ sudo python photobot_installer.py

- The installer asks for confirmation before each task. This way you can
 always rerun it, confirming only the tasks you want to run
- On any error, it will ask if you want to exit. If you know it's ok to continue, you can
 do so.

- To see what the installer will do, you can do a dry run with:
  $ sudo python photobot_installer.py --dry-run
- A dry run will print every bash command the installer would do instead of executing it
- If you want to setup wireless networking, you will need your network name and
  password for the installer. It's fine to skip this and keep using an ethernet cable

- If you would like explanations of what the installer is doing, see the companion
  file to this one, "photobot_instructions_2017", in which each step is detailed
  for manual entry

AIS notes:
Automatic Identification System

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_identification_system

- base station is used to track position of the vessels with AIS tranceivers

From wikipedia:

Class A units: (large commercial vessels)
An AIS transceiver sends the following data every 2 to 10 seconds depending
on a vessel's speed while underway, and every 3 minutes while a vessel is at anchor:

- The vessel's Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) – a unique nine digit identification number.
- Navigation status – "at anchor", "under way using engine(s)", "not under command", etc.
- Rate of turn – right or left, from 0 to 720 degrees per minute
- Speed over ground – 0.1-knot (0.19 km/h) resolution from 0 to 102 knots (189 km/h)
- Positional accuracy:
    - Longitude – to 0.0001 minutes
    - Latitude – to 0.0001 minutes
- Course over ground – relative to true north to 0.1°
- True heading – 0 to 359 degrees (for example from a gyro compass)
- True bearing at own position. 0 to 359 degrees
- UTC Seconds – The seconds field of the UTC time when these data were generated.
  A complete timestamp is not present.

In addition, the following data are broadcast every 6 minutes:
- IMO ship identification number – a seven digit number that remains unchanged upon 
  transfer of the ship's registration to another country
- Radio call sign – international radio call sign, up to seven characters, 
  assigned to the vessel by its country of registry
- Name – 20 characters to represent the name of the vessel
- Type of ship/cargo
- Dimensions of ship – to nearest meter
- Location of positioning system's (e.g., GPS) antenna on board the vessel 
  - in meters aft of bow and meters port or starboard
- Type of positioning system – such as GPS, DGPS or LORAN-C.
- Draught of ship – 0.1 meter to 25.5 meters
- Destination – max. 20 characters
- ETA (estimated time of arrival) at destination – UTC month/date hour:minute
- optional : high precision time request, a vessel can request other vessels provide
  a high precision UTC time and datestamp


Class B (ligher commercial, leisure)
Four messages are defined for class B units:

- Message 14 Safety Related Message: 
  This message is transmitted on request for the user some transceivers have a button 
  that enables it to be sent, or it can be sent through 
  the software interface. It sends a pre-defined safety message.

- Message 18: Standard Class B CS Position Report: This message is sent every 3 minutes
  where speed over ground (SOG) is less than 2 knots, or every 30 seconds for greater
  speeds. MMSI, time, SOG, COG, longitude, latitude, true heading

- Message 19, Extended Class B Equipment Position Report: 
  This message was designed for the SOTDMA protocol, and is too long to be transmitted 
  as CSTDMA. However a coast station can poll the transceiver for this message to be 
  sent. MMSI, time, SOG, COG, longitude, latitude, true heading, ship type, dimensions.

- Message 24 Class B CS Static Data Report: 
  This message is sent every 6 minutes, the same time interval as for Class A transponders.
  Because of its length, this message is divided into two parts, sent within one minute
  of each other. This message was defined after the original AIS specifications, so some 
  Class A units may need a firmware upgrade to be able to decode this message. MMSI, boat
  name, ship type, call sign, dimensions, and equipment vendor id.


NMEA 1083
- data is transmitted using the NMEA 1083 protocal
- from wikipedia: There is a variation of the standard called NMEA-0183HS that specifies a baud rate of 38,400. This is in general use by AIS devices.
- digital yacht has a "Digital Yachts NMEA Data Display Program" we can use to see if there is any raw NMEA data coming out of the AISNet
  - only exists on windows
- look for one on OSX

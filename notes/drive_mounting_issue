Drive mounting issue

- sometimes drive doesn't mount and thus fstab fails and the system hangs

Solution:
- run a program from cron that attempts to mount the drive
- retval = os.system('mount /dev/sda99 /mnt/foobar')
  - returns non-zero on failure

- so how would the system know if we've already mounted?
  - we could write a flag to the system

- can we delay a per minute cron?
  - we could have it exit if the drive flag is not present

- we could have photobot check how long the system has been up?

- $ uptime -p
  - returns "up" if up less than a minute
  - returns "up 1 minute" for longer
  - so photobot script could check uptime and only run if it's been
    up more than a minute

- programmatically check whether a disk mounted ok?
   if grep -qs '/mnt/foo ' /proc/mounts; then it's mounted
   - need to try that on the pi

- to figure out:
  - where is the SD drive?
  - what's the mountpoint of the usb thing


TODO CODE:
- first time photobot runs, it should bail out unless uptime
  is more than one minute
  - check results of "uptime -p" from python

- we want to add init program to boot
  - try to mount the drive
    - if mount fails, mount sd card
  - make symlink to drive location
  - if mount failed, it should notify us somehow
    mailing from the box likely won't work, but posting a
    request to the control panel will

- cron for running on reboot
  @reboot /home/pi/master/env/bin/python /home/pi/master/src/photobot_lorex.py

 /home/pi/master/src/photobot_lorex.py

- there is a gnome monitor that tries to mount the camera, gvfs-mount
  - possible solution: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/273482/disabling-usb-automount-in-gnome3

- to alter on old photobot:
  - add the wait command from the new one
  - change where it writes to
